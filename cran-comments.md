## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* There was no note from the `R CMD check` command. I only get possibly mispelled words in the DESCRIPTION file from the rhub report. They are:

  - Arabie (14:749)
  - Clus (14:59, 14:365, 14:455, 14:614)
  - FKMeans (14:429, 14:633)
  - Fkmeans (14:69)
  - TWCFTA (14:620, 14:701)
  - TWFCTA (14:642, 14:726)
  - Vichi (14:225, 14:492)
  - al (14:234, 14:501)
  - dimensionality (14:137)
  - et (14:231, 14:498)
  - hyperparameter (14:385)

Pertaining  to the models implemented, these are valid names/words and should not be considered as errors.

* Additionally, the `spell_check` command as well detected same words. An exhaustive list is provided below.
  - centroids
  - 3FKMeans
  - CT3Clus
  - TWCFTA
  - TWFCTA
  - matricization
  - PseudoF
  - stdev
  - svd
  - matricize
  - ij
  - jk
  - ki
  
  The above mentioned are all valid pertaining to the models.
