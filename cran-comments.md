## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* There was no note from the `R CMD check` command. I only get possibly mispelled words in the DESCRIPTION file from the rhub report. They are:

  - Arabie (14:745)
  - Clus (14:59, 14:363, 14:453, 14:610)
  - FKMeans (14:427, 14:629)
  - Fkmeans (14:69)
  - TWCFTA (14:616, 14:697)
  - TWFCTA (14:638, 14:722)
  - Vichi (14:225, 14:490)
  - al (14:234, 14:499)
  - et (14:231, 14:496)

Pertaining  to the models implemented, these are valid names/words and should not be considered as errors.
