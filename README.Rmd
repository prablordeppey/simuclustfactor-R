# simuclustfactor

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of simuclustfactor is to perform:

* tandem clustering and factor-decomposition procedures sequentially (TWCFTA and TWFCTA).
* simultaneous clustering and factor decomposition procedures simultaneously (T3Clus and 3FKMeans).
* combined T3Clus and 3FKMeans procedures simultaneously (CT3Clus).

## Installation

You can install the development version of simuclustfactor from [GitHub](https://github.com/prablordeppey/simuclustfactor-r) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("prablordeppey/simuclustfactor-r")
```

## Implementations

Synthetic Dataset Generation (Additive noise)

``` r
library(simuclustfactor)

# Defining tensor dimensions in full and reduced spaces.
I=8; J=5; K=4 # number of objects, variables and occasions respectively.
G=3; Q=3; R=2 # number of clusters, factors for variable and factors for occasion respectively.
data = generate_dataset(I, J, K, G, Q, R, mean=0, stdev=0.5, random_state=0)  # generate synthetic dataset with noise level 0.5. 

# Extracting the data
Y_g_qr = data$Y_g_qr  # centroids matrix in the reduced space.
Z_i_jk = data$Z_i_jk  # score/centroid matrix in the full-space.
X_i_jk = data$X_i_jk  # dataset with noise.

# Ground-truth parameters
U_i_g = data$U_i_g  # binary stochastic membership matrix
B_j_q = data$B_j_q  # variables factor matrix
C_k_r = data$C_k_r  # occasions factor matrix

# Ground-truth associations
U_i_g = data$U_labels  # array of clusters for objects
B_j_q = data$B_labels  # array of factors for each variable
C_k_r = data$C_labels  # array of factors for each occasion

# Folding generated data matrices into tensors
X_i_j_k = fold(X_i_jk, mode=1, shape=c(I,J,K))
Z_i_j_k = fold(Z_i_jk, mode=1, shape=c(I,J,K))
Y_g_q_r = fold(Y_g_qr, mode=1, shape=c(G,Q,R))

```
