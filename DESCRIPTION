Description: Implements two iterative techniques called T3Clus and 3Fkmeans, aimed at simultaneously clustering objects and a factorial dimensionality reduction of variables and occasions on three-mode datasets developed by Vichi et al. (2007) <doi:10.1007/s00357-007-0006-x>. Also, we provide a convex combination of these two simultaneous procedures called CT3Clus and based on a hyperparameter alpha (alpha in [0,1], with 3FKMeans for alpha=0 and T3Clus for alpha= 1) also developed by Vichi et al. (2007) <doi:10.1007/s00357-007-0006-x>. Furthermore, we implemented the traditional tandem procedures of T3Clus (TWCFTA) and 3FKMeans (TWFCTA) for sequential clustering-factorial decomposition (TWCFTA), and vice-versa (TWFCTA) proposed by P. Arabie and L. Hubert (1996) <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-79999-0_1>.
