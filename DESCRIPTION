Description: The package implements two iterative techniques called T3Clus and 3Fkmeans, aimed at simultaneously clustering objects and a factorial dimensionality reduction of variables and occasions on three-mode datasets. In addition, an implementation combining these two simultaneous procedures called CT3Clus integrates a hyperparameter alpha, where alpha=0 evaluates to 3FKMeans and alpha=1 is T3Clus. Furthermore, the traditional tandem procedures of T3Clus (TWCFTA) and 3FKMeans (TWFCTA) for sequential clustering-factorial decomposition (TWCFTA) and vice-versa (TWFCTA) were implemented in the package.
